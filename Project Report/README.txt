There is an explanation for how we solve the equation in each of the folder. There is also  a folder called program code which contains the code that we have implemented to verify this functions. The names on the code explains for which function that code is.

For running the code:

No need for external libraries for running the code.
First check the java version running on windows using java -version

For compling the code
From the Command Prompt, navigate to the directory containing your .java files, say C:\introcs\hello, by typing the cd command below.
C:\Users\username>cd c:\introcs\hello
C:\introcs\hello\>

Assuming the file, say HelloWorld.java, is in the current working directory, type the javac command in boldface below to compile it.
C:\introcs\hello\>javac HelloWorld.java
C:\introcs\hello\>


For running the code
You will use the java command to execute your program.

From the Command Prompt, type the java command below.
C:\introcs\hello\>java HelloWorld
